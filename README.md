## HOMEWORK4 - Web APIs JavaScript code-quiz

For this project I created a small code quiz to test our level of knowledge about JavaScript. The main purpose of this little fun game is to apply all the resources provided by our trainer during our classes. JavaScript, HTML, CSS & images skills are applied into the coding. 

It contains:
- A HTML file which my layout is structured.
- A CSS style file which personalises the gaming experience to its users.
- A countdown timer.
- A JavaScript file with all the game functionalities.
